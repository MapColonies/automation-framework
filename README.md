#  Backend-Automation-Framework-Python Template

### Project Overview
Welcome to **Backend-Automation-Framework-Python**! This project, developed by **Dimitry**, is a robust and extensible automation testing framework focused on backend and API testing. It offers a well-structured approach to functional, regression, and sanity testing of backend services.

The framework leverages popular Python tools and libraries such as `pytest`, `requests`, and `allure` to provide a full suite of testing capabilities. By following best practices, such as modular architecture, comprehensive logging, and pre-commit hooks, the framework aims to be reusable, easy to maintain, and scalable.

### Key Features
- **Modular and Extensible Architecture**: Core components are divided into layers such as core services, utilities, and tests, ensuring high modularity and reusability.
- **API Testing Support**: Easily test RESTful APIs using core and service classes.
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions (`ci_cd_pipeline.yml`) included for automated testing and deployment.
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Uses `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to maintain code quality standards.
- **Logging and Reporting**: Integrated logging for debugging and detailed test reports using `allure`.
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Transient errors are automatically retried using the `tenacity` library.
- **Mocking API Responses**: Utilizes `responses` library for mocking HTTP requests during testing, ensuring tests are independent of the backend server.

### Requirements
The following dependencies are used in the framework and can be installed using `requirements.txt`:

```
requests==2.28.1
pytest==7.1.2
pytest-html==3.2.0
tenacity==8.0.1
python-dotenv==1.0.0
allure-pytest==2.9.45
responses==0.20.0
pre-commit==3.0.4
```
To install the dependencies, use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Backend-Automation-Framework-Python
   ```

2. **Set up Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run Tests**:
   - Run all tests:
     ```bash
     pytest src/tests --alluredir=reports/allure-results
     ```
   - View detailed test reports generated by Allure:
     ```bash
     allure serve reports/allure-results
     ```

### Running Pre-commit Hooks
To maintain coding standards, install the pre-commit hooks defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```
This will ensure that every time you commit, the code is checked for formatting issues, linting errors, and any other checks defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

### Using Docker
The project can be containerized using Docker to ensure consistency across different environments.

1. **Build the Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t backend-automation-framework-python .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -it backend-automation-framework-python
   ```

3. **Using Docker Compose**:
   You can also use Docker Compose to manage the services more easily:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

### CI/CD Pipeline
The project integrates with **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD. The workflow defined in `.github/workflows/ci_cd_pipeline.yml` performs the following:
- Runs tests on every push or pull request to the `main` branch.
- Generates reports and artifacts for easy review.
- Deploys to the server (if defined in the pipeline).

### Contributing
If you would like to contribute:
- Fork the repository.
- Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`).
- Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
- Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature`).
- Open a Pull Request.
